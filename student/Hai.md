## 5 things I learned today
- Git is a version control tool which is very helpful and important in software development work.
- git config: take care of local and global configurations of the project
- git alias: you can create your own custom commands using alias
- git ssh: allow for secure authentication when accessing github repo
- git revert and git reset: are used for uncommit but git revert is more safe with history
